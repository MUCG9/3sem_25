 Write a 'shell-wrapper' program which allow users to:

    - run programs via command line cyclically getting commands from STDIN and running 	    it somewhere, e.g. in child process.
    - get exit codes of terminated programs
    - use pipelining of program sequences, for ex.: «env | grep HOSTNAME | wc»
